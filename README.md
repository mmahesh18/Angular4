# Angular4 
Angular 4 or angular is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end web application platform led by the Angular Team at Google. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS. But let me tell you that Angular is completely different from AngularJS. Let us understand the differences between Angular and AngularJS:

The architecture of an Angular application is different from AngularJS. The main building blocks for Angular are modules, components, templates, metadata, data binding, directives, services and dependency injection. We will be looking at it in a while.
Angular was a complete rewrite of AngularJS.
Angular does not have a concept of “scope” or controllers instead, it uses a hierarchy of components as its main architectural concept.
Angular has a simpler expression syntax, focusing on “[ ]” for property binding, and “( )” for event binding
# Mobile development 
Desktop development is much easier when mobile performance issues are handled first. Thus, Angular first handles mobile development.
Modularity – Angular follows modularity. Similar functionalities are kept together in same modules. This gives Angular a lighter & faster core.
Now, let us talk about Angular 4. Angular community has introduced some significant changes to angular 4 and therefore, the major version number has been changed from 2 to 4 (skipping 3). The reason behind directly jumping to Angular 4 and skipping the version 3 was that the router package was in version 3.x, so instead of putting everything to 3.0 and the router to 4.0, the team chose to upgrade the versions of all the ng - modules to 4.0.

Let me tell you one more important news that the angular community has decided for some timely based releases occurring in three different phases:

Angular patches will be released every week
Few minor releases will be followed by major release
At last, there will be a major release every 6 months.
