# Angular4 
This course starts from scratch, you neither need to know Angular 1 nor Angular 2! (Angular 5 simply is the latest version of Angular 2)
From Setup to Deployment, this course covers it all! You'll learn all about Components, Directives, Services, Forms, Http Access, Authentication, Optimizing an Angular App with Modules and Offline Compilation and much more - and in the end: You'll learn how to deploy an application!

But that's not all! This course will also show you how to use the Angular CLI and feature a complete project, which allows you to practice the things learned throughout the course!
